# Predictive Maintenance Model

## Description
This project implements a machine learning model designed to predict equipment failures based on historical operational data. By leveraging predictive analytics, this model aims to enable proactive maintenance, thereby reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model architecture built with Keras and TensorFlow
- Training with callbacks for early stopping and model checkpointing
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance
- Future work suggestions for continuous improvement

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and metrics
- **Keras**: For building and training the neural network
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predictive-Maintenance-Model.git
cd Predictive-Maintenance-Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation
1. Load your dataset using Pandas.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling features.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Model Training
The model is defined in `3.ipynb`. You can train the model using the following command:

```bash
python 3.ipynb
```

### Evaluation
After training, the model's performance can be evaluated using the classification report generated in the evaluation step.

## Results
The model's performance can be assessed through various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which are displayed in the classification report.

## Future Work
- Explore additional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
- Investigate feature importance and engineering.
